/**
 * Install-from-backup boot hook.
 *
 * **The problem this closes**
 *
 * Without this hook, recovering a picpeak install from a backup is a
 * six-step process:
 *   1. Stand up the compose stack with empty volumes
 *   2. Wait for boot → land on the onboarding wizard
 *   3. Create a throwaway fresh-install admin
 *   4. Navigate to Backup → Restore
 *   5. Walk through the wizard with Force Restore ticked
 *   6. Log out, log back in with original (pre-disaster) credentials
 *
 * With this hook, admins skip steps 2-6. They place their backup
 * artefacts in the existing bind-mounted /backup directory, drop a
 * trigger file alongside, and the next container start runs the
 * restore BEFORE creating the throwaway onboarding admin. Server
 * comes up populated, original login works first try.
 *
 * **The trigger file convention (chosen for zero compose-file changes)**
 *
 * Drop a file named `RESTORE_ON_INSTALL` (no extension, or .txt) into
 * the root of the `/backup` mount. Two payload variants:
 *
 *   1. EMPTY file (or pure whitespace) — auto-pick the newest
 *      `backup-manifest-*.json` from `/backup/manifests/`. Useful when
 *      the admin doesn't know or care which one is most recent.
 *
 *   2. NON-EMPTY file containing a relative or absolute path to a
 *      specific manifest. Trimmed; first line wins. Useful when the
 *      admin wants a specific older backup.
 *
 * After a successful restore the trigger file is DELETED so the next
 * boot doesn't re-trigger. On failure the file is preserved + the
 * error is logged, so the admin can fix the input and retry by just
 * restarting the container.
 *
 * **Safety**
 *
 * Three layers gate this against accidental data loss:
 *   1. Trigger file must exist (intentional admin action, not auto-magic)
 *   2. DB must be empty — admin_users.count = 0 AND events.count = 0.
 *      If either is non-zero, the hook refuses to run.
 *   3. The Stage A restore path (with all of tonight's fixes) handles
 *      the actual swap atomically. If anything fails, the rollback
 *      runs and the install stays in fresh-install state.
 *
 * Override: `INSTALL_FROM_BACKUP_FORCE=true` skips the empty-DB check
 * for the "I know what I'm doing" edge case (e.g. dev environment
 * rebuilds where there's leftover data that's safe to clobber).
